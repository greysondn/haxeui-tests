Description
===========

I've noticed that buttons don't have a right edge anymore, and some buttons go
kinda wonky when you hover over them. This project exists to collect those and
any other button-based issues I find in one place.

The top two buttons have no right edge and go completely square if you hover
them.

The bottom two buttons go wonky if you hover them.

There may be others; this however is probably a solid start.

Not much to say, honestly. I'll update this as I find other button-based
problems.
