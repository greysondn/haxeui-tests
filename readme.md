This repo contains test cases for haxeui, because I'm up to four of them now and needed a place to start storing them if this is going to continue.

Some of these are likely to be legitimate complaints; others are likely to be me being an idiot. You've been forewarned.

Each subfolder is its own project with notes. Feel free to open them up and examine them. Some may even be useful as examples, to an extent.
