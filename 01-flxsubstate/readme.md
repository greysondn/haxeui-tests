I had tried to use haxeui-flixel with flxsubstate. This didn't cooperate. This lead to some discussion in the community discord, and these test cases. I wanted to try this a few different ways (as seemed to be suggested) and just see what happens.

Ian wanted me to try it (I believe) both in a way that aligned with flixel and in a way that aligned with what was expected for haxeui. MSGhero seemed convinced that some toying around would fix it. I developed a couple ideas of where to go on my own after talking to them.

These try to be minimal cases. I never make any promises.
