===========

For some odd reason, text reflow in haxeui-flixel just breaks in flash. So this
is an attempt at a minimal case for that.

Open the substate, close it, and then open it again. It should fail in Flash if
I did my job right.

Yes, I really designed this to match my current setup, including the awful
classes I wrote.
